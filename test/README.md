# TPU Test Suite

This directory encompasses the test suite for our 2x2 TPU.

## Structure

The test suite contains both per-module and system integration tests within their own directories:

* `control_unit/`: Control unit tests
* `memory/`: Unified memory tests
* `mmu_feeder/`: Matrix Unit Feeder tests
* `systolic_array/`: Systolic Array tests
* `tpu/`: Top-level system integration tests

## Setting up

### Local environment

If you are running these tests locally, you will need:

 * Python
 * Icarus Verilog

Both can be installed with your package manager of choice.

From the `test` directory, create a Python virtual environment:

```python
python -m venv <ENV_NAME>

# Linux/macOS
source <ENV_NAME>/bin/activate

# Windows
<ENV_NAME>\Scripts\activate
```

Regardless of whether you require a virtual environment or are running the tests on a pre-configured server, there are some necessary packages that must be installed:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

The `Makefile` in the test directory has been set up with targets for each module and the top-level:

```c
// Per-module tests
make test-top // System integration
make test-memory
make test-systolic-array
make test-control-unit
make test-mmu-feeder

// Run all tests 
make all

// Cleanup build artifacts
make clean
```

To run gate-level simulations, specify the `GATES` flag for `test-top`:

```c
make test-top GATES=yes
```

## Test Information

### Control Unit Tests

**File:** `test_control_unit.py`

**Test Cases**:

* **Reset**: verifies all control signals (mem_addr, mmu_en, mmu_cycle) are properly zeroed when reset is asserted
* **Idle State**: ensures control unit remains in idle state with all outputs at zero when load_en is not asserted for multiple cycles
* **Matrix Loading**: tests 8-cycle matrix loading phase with proper memory address incrementing (0-7) and MMU enable assertion when sufficient elements are loaded
* **MMU Compute Phase**: validates MMU enable signals remain high and mmu_cycle counter increments correctly (2-7) during computation and writeback
* **Full Cycle**: tests complete operation sequence from idle → matrix loading → MMU computation → back to compute state with proper signal transitions
* **Load Enable Handling**: verifies load_en signal toggling is properly ignored during MMU compute phase while mmu_cycle continues incrementing normally
* **Multiple Operations**: stress tests control unit with 100 consecutive operation cycles to ensure state machine reliability and proper signal timing

### Unified Memory Tests

**File:** `test_memory.py`

**Test Cases**:

* **Reset**: check if all values are zeroed when `rst` is asserted.
* **Sequential Read/Write**: write to all `sram` addresses and check the outputs at each address.
* **Load Enable Writes**: verify that writes only occur with `load_en` high.
* **Overwrite Addresses**: write two values to an address; second value should overwrite the first one.
* **Write During Reset**: ensure the validity of a reset if `rst` and `load_en` are asserted in the same cycle.
* **Randomized Burst**: randomized addresses and data are generated within a valid range, written, and read for verification.

### Matrix Unit Feeder Tests

**File:** `test_mmu_feeder.py`

**Test Cases**:

* **Regular, Edge Case, and Transpose**: Test mmu_feeder with regular matrix inputs (minimal functionality), edge case matrix input (check expected behavior with extreme inputs), and regular matrix inputs with tranpose enabled (check transpose functionality).
* **Random Test Vectors**: Generates 10 random Input/Weight matrix pairs and processes them sequentially, checking output against expected values.

**Note**: Expected output control signal values from mmu_feeder (i.e clear and done) are asserted at each mmu_cycle, covering all mmu_feeder functionality.

### Systolic Array Tests

**File:** `test_systolic_array.py`

**Test Cases**:

* **Basic 2x2 Matrix Multiplication**: validates core systolic array functionality with predefined 2x2 matrices, testing proper data flow through processing elements and correct computation of matrix multiplication (A=[[1,2],[3,4]], B=[[5,6],[7,8]], expected C=[[19,22],[43,50]])

### Top-level Tests

**File:** `test_tpu.py`

**Test Cases**:

* **ReLU and Transpose Operations**: tests ReLU activation function and matrix transpose functionality with pipelined loading and reading, validating correct handling of negative values and matrix orientation changes
* **Large Matrix Operations**: stress tests with randomly generated matrices up to 20x20, measuring operations per second and testing all combinations of transpose/ReLU flags to ensure scalability and performance
* **Project Integration Test**: comprehensive end-to-end test simulating full TPU operation with sequential matrix operations
  - Tests signed arithmetic edge cases with values ranging from -128 to 127
  - Validates pipeline clearing between consecutive matrix operations
  - Verifies proper output sequencing across multiple matrix computations
  - Tests extreme value combinations (-128 × 127, -128 × -128)
  - Ensures correct handling of result overflow and saturation

## Viewing waveforms

Each module's test directory has a `wave` directory, which contains `.vcd` waveforms generated after each test. These can be viewed with either `surfer` or `GTKWave`:

```sh
# GTKWave
gtkwave tb.vcd

# Surfer
surfer tb.vcd
```
